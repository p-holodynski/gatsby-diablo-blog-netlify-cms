We expect to become Immortals very soon. To acomplish this we must stay active and motivated.

## Tips for shadow war

1. Try to always be available for Shadow Wars on Thursdays and Saturdays.
2. Please listen to your clan leader and officers.
3. Don't spam in the chat, it makes harder to read the instructions about the war.
4. Timing is key, donâ€™t forget to show up on time.
