From here forward Kion's will also be held on days in which the strategy is set to concentrate power to maximize the dominance gains when we do the runs. We are saving to afford the cost of both the current level 4 and building our piggy bank for future level 5 when we get there. 

There will be no Kion's on 9/6. We will update and ping this channel as soon as we know which days and times are planned. 

We are still working on Rite of Exile info as we will most likely have our 1st this week. This info will also get out to you ASAP, planning it is a large task to undertake while still being able to enjoy the game when we have time outside of our work, jobs etc. 

Thank you for your patience.
