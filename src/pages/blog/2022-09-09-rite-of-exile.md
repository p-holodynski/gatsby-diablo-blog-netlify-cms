This is our most important event as immortals where we'll be battling the top 10 shadow clans.

As a heads up, there'll be 80 spots (10 teams of 8) and we'll be providing various avenues for entry: 

• Power - battlegrounds experience and PvP CR 

• Activity - most active players by paragon, contribution, etc 

• Engagement - registering early, showing up on time, standing by as a sub for previous weeks, etc 

As the shadows strengthen over time, we'll be prioritizing power. But for now, expect activity and engagement to be the main factors.
