Times will be:

* 1 session in the morning (10:00 AM)
* 1 session after noon vault (1:15 PM)
* 1 session after evening vault/rite of exile (8:15 PM)
* 1 flex session - likely used after the 8:15 PM session, but will adjust as appropriate

  We'll be running the dominance buff a few days earlier again to optimize gains. Go ahead and dump all your sigils whenever it's at 36. (Sunday still remains a guaranteed turn-in day)
